## Introduction
This project implements an image classifier using the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. Vision Transformers have shown great promise in image classification tasks by leveraging the power of transformer models in the computer vision domain.

## Features
- Image classification using Vision Transformer (ViT)
- Easy setup and deployment
- Modular code for ease of understanding and extension

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 (ensure Python 3.11.x is installed on your machine)
- Git

## Setup

### Fork the Repository
1. Go to the [project repository](https://github.com/shubha987/Image-Classifier-ViT) on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the repository.

### Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-Classifier-ViT.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the Project Directory
   ```sh
   cd Image-Classifier-ViT
   ```
### Create a Virtual Environment
1. Ensure Python 3.11 is installed:
   ```sh
   python3.11 --version
   ```
   If Python 3.11 is not installed, you can install it using the following commands:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3.11
   sudo apt install python3.11-venv
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment using Python 3.11:
   ```sh
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   ```

### Activate the Virtual Environment
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
### Install Dependencies
1. Ensure you have `pip` installed and updated:
   ```sh
   python -m ensurepip --upgrade
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### Usage
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated:
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
